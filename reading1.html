        Toph Tucker’s and Jasmine Lee’s take on why Restaurant websites are good and we’re all going to miss them was extremely eye-opening. Before reading this article, I never thought deeply about restaurant websites.

    <p>It was really interesting how Tucker discussed both the positives and negatives of different tools, such as Squarespace. He acknowledges that while these platforms make websites easier to build and maintain, they also limit creativity and individuality by forcing restaurants into templates. I also appreciated Lee’s perspective on the labor behind maintaining these websites and how unrealistic it can be for restaurant workers to constantly update them. Overall, this reading really made me think about all the restaurant pages Ive seen and what makes them strong.
