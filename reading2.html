        Reading “The New Turing Test” made me rethink what actually gives creative work its value. I strongly agree that meaningful work should come from a specific person, be created for a specific audience, and exist within a clear context. Without those qualities, creative work can feel empty or interchangeable, even if it looks polished. I also think this human-centered standard matters even more when considering the environmental cost of AI, since training and running these systems requires massive amounts of energy and resources. If content lacks intention or emotional depth, it feels wasteful to use such powerful technology to produce work that does not truly communicate or connect.
